                        <h4>Description</h4>
                        <p>The Pressed Mattifying Mineral Veil sets translucently over the skin, naturally extending make-up wear. Its unique feather-light formula helps control oil and shine, while disguising fine lines and wrinkles with its light-reflecting micro particles. The powder is composed of active natural ingredients, including the native Australian Kakadu Plum, known for its abundant Vitamin C content, and Cehami Extract, to benefit the skin. The fragrance-free formula also contains Vitamin E, Avocado Oil, Jojoba Oil and Shea Butter to help perfect your complexion.</p>
                        <h4>How to Use</h4>
                        <p>Lightly apply the Pressed Mattifying Mineral Veil all over the face using the Brush, focusing on areas that tend to shine. Retouch throughout the day, as needed, to help control oil and shine.</p>
