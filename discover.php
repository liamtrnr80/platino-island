            <p>The most common include liquid, stick, cream, BB cream, cushion cream, and a powder (mineral, loose or pressed) foundation. No wonder selecting the perfect foundation for your skin can be confusing. </p>
            <p>Foundation is a make-up product that creates an even finish to your skin, matching with your complexion, and is used on the face, neck and sometimes body. As the name suggests, it's the foundation for your make-up. Foundation has quite an interesting history. It’s said to have originated in ancient Rome and Greece, and here’s the thing, back then it was formulated with a poisonous chalk, also known as white lead. As you can imagine there were some pretty horrific side effects including losing teeth, hair loss and skin discolouration. During the 19th Century, foundation formula evolved (thank goodness!) into a liquid form, and it was in the 1930’s when powder foundation was first created, courtesy of Max Factor in Hollywood, who wanted to create a foundation that provided a more natural finish on screen. Its name? Pan-Cake.</p>

            <p class="uk-text-lead">From watery eyes to sudden breakouts, makeup can bring a whole host of issues to sensitive skin.</p>

            <p>To avoid ruining your makeup and most importantly, damaging your skin, we asked a dermatologist and a makeup artist to provide their best advice.</p>
            <p class="uk-text-lead">BEFORE YOU BUY YOUR MAKEUP</p>
            <p>Before you even get to applying your makeup, there are some points to keep in mind when you’re purchasing products.</p>
            <p class="uk-text-lead">Don’t pile it all on</p>
            <p>Before you even get to applying your makeup, there are some points to keep in mind when you’re purchasing products.‘If you have oily or acne prone skin, try to avoid heavy, long-wear foundations as they tend to block pores. It is best to opt for formulas that are relatively light and ‘non-comedogenic’. Although you want to cover up any blemishes, you need to let your skin breathe and not aggravate it further.’</p>
            <p class="uk-text-lead">Consider your ingredients</p>
            <p>‘If you have dry or irritated skin, steer clear of products with alcohols in the main ingredient list. Alcohols in your makeup can cause irritation, dryness, and in some cases, increased oil production.</p>
            <p>'The alcohols to be concerned about in skincare products are ethanol or ethyl alcohol, denatured alcohol, methanol, isopropyl alcohol, SD alcohol, and benzyl alcohol.’</p>
            <p class="uk-text-lead">Avoid fragranced products</p>
            <p>'Sensitive skin can often react badly to perfumed or scented make up products. Perfume allergies are common in those with sensitive skin, and can cause redness, irritation and rashes.</p>
            <p>'Choosing foundations and cream products that are fragrance free reduces the risk of aggravation or the flare up of conditions such as eczema.'</p>

            <p class="uk-text-lead">APPLYING YOUR MAKEUP</p>
            <p>Knowing how to approach sensitive skin prior to application can make all the difference.</p>
            <p class="uk-text-lead">Consider textures</p>
            <p>‘The most important thing to consider when buying eye makeup is texture. Is it easy to work with or not? Does it blend easily into the skin and does the texture respond to your needs, such as extra hold, non-creasing, designed for contact lenses or for sensitive eyes?</p>
            <p>‘Start off with soft pigmented textures as they will always be easier to handle than those beautiful tempting rich colours.</p>
            <p class="uk-text-lead">Cover up redness properly</p>
            <p>On the eyes, avoid green correctors around the eye area as they will change the undertone of the lid. Instead, select a beige or apricot corrector to neutralise any colour on the upper lid. It will create a result that will be look more natural and blend more easily while taking care of both redness or blue undertones.</p>
            <p class="uk-text-lead">Prep your skin properly</p>
            <p>‘When prepping the skin, avoid soap-based products. Additionally, avoid harsh toners as the astringent textures might cause irritation.</p>
            <p>'After cleansing, a cold water cloth application will cool the skin, while preparing it for moisturising.</p>
            <p>'Finally, use a soothing texture following the cleansing of the skin that will lock and retain hydration in the skin.'</p>
